ga830202,,"I sewed Pooky's arm back on as good as new, Garfield.","Yes, but will he ever play the piano again? Me thinks the cat doth expect too much."
ga830203,You did a pretty good job of sewing Pooky's arm on.,I used small stitches so as not no leave a scar.,I think he's picking on me.
ga830204,"Pooky, when you lost your arm, I got to thinking about our mortality, and that's depressing.","So promise me you'll never lose your arm again, okay?",

ga830207,I wonder what awful thing is going to happen to me today? Maybe the sky will fall. Maybe Odie will bring his long lost twin brother home...,,"Or worse yet, maybe Nermal will come for a visit."
ga830208,"Oh sure, you're getting all the attention right now, Nermal, But when you grow up you'll be as unloved as I am.",I'm never growing up. Who are you? Peter Pan or something?,I'm a midget. Some cats get all the luck.

ga830223,,Jogging is much more enjoyable if you have the proper motivation.,Ding Dong ICE CREAM

ga830319,"Give me a kiss, sweetheart.",KISS,How do you tell a lady her mustache needs more wax?

ga830423,"This is going to upset you, Garfield...",Because I know you've had a great time.,But it's time we think about going home.
ga830426,,,And just what do you think you're doing? Asserting my cathood?
ga830427,"Garfield, why is it cats like to get out at night?",That's when we like to sing on fences.,"In the daylight, we'd be easy targets."
